  summary: Modern Realistic Subway Station V2
  description: |-
    Back again with my v2 of my modern realsitic subway station. V2 includes some features, like better textures, a redesigned elevator, plotable versions for not only roads, but avenues too. Both are UDI enabled, so it acts as a road/avenue, and a subway station. The model is similar to v1, but v2 has improved models, as well as textures, higher capacity and more realsitic ulitity usage, and improved lot layout. There is included installation instructions, as well as all dependencies are included. Here are some more details about each lot.
