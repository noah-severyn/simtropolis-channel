#   description: |
#     Introducing my Light Project (MGB-LP), where I intend to re-lot some common packages that are too bright when used with USL/LRM, due to overlapping lightcones.

#     Notice: Built from these changes, @philforhockey51 has created a further revised version with seasonal trees and with 4 new Bikepath styles to choose between. Of course my version will remain here, but you might want to check out Phil's excellent relots, which also adds diagonal pieces and is IMO the definitive version of the Bikepaths now.

#     These changes cover the original Bikepaths, in addition to three addons, two by Paeng, the SSDP and Extenders, plus 3 bonus lots I created for my own personal use. All of these lots (except one) have been given USL/LRM lightcones, plus I also changed the hedges to Girafe's Seasonal ones.

#     Dependencies (in addition to those for the original set):
#     * USL or LRM (only the LightCones are needed):
#       * From the USL download:
#             Lights_LightCones.dat
#       * From the LRM download:
#             LightCones_MaxisNite.dat
#                             or
#             LightCones_DarkNite.dat
#       * Girafe's Seasonal Hedges

#     As you can see, they look great at night (using Mashty's Night Mod) and have been carefully designed so they don't leak light places where bright spots might occur.

#     The Functional Bus Stop has been updated to more modern standards, with a larger capacity and correct TSEC/switches, it's Mac Compatible.

#     Optionally, you can also change the Bus Stop so it takes on the style of your RTMT install. In other words, it will use the same BusShelter/BusSign and TimeTable props as your other RTMT lots (requires RTMT v3.6 or later):
