#     PHIL - Scoty Modular Pond

#     A set of neutral Modular Pond Lots with a grass base texture.   
#     The lots are 1x1 with a pond edge overlay texture that can be used to make a larger pond.  
#     You will find the lots in folders labeled to indicate the shoreline, some are at a higher level some on a lower, transitions between the two, and even some with a beach shoreline. SPOT props added to help with placement.   
#     Within the download you will also find a Submenus patch folder for those that use submenus and have the required dependencies to use them.

#     There is no way to sugarcoat this so I'll just say it, Scoty studio really took a hit this go around with losses of Kevins reaching double digits. A whole team went out to do research but when Kevin 32 and Kevin 28 went down with that row boat it set off a whole chain of events, Kevin 33 rushed into another boat to help along with Kevin 35 and Kevin 36 but they took it from the repair yard and it had holes in it... Also we'd like to remind everyone to be aware of the dangers of quicksand and of unseen animals in the water.

#     Big Thanks to hugues aroux for just about everything, textures, icons and the submenu patch
