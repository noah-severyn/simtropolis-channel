    Hello many good mayors! This is my2nd post.  
    I made simple LOTs set that designed with "Jpanaese popular walls".  
    You can use **favorite one** from two kinds of sets(types) in this work.  
      
      
    **1\. "JPN Walls All - Design"**  
    You can use LOTs by choosing only a favorite number from among the wall of 5 designs.  
    However, a large amount of icons in the Game are added only as for the number.  
      
      
    **2\. "JPN Walls One - Design"**  
    You can use LOTs by choosing only one texture of the wall from among five walls textures.  
    Only the wall of the design of one per one map can be used though the number of increases of icons is minimum.  
      
    The difference of the design of each texture can be seen [***HERE***](http://img106.imageshack.us/img106/7281/jpnwallstextureshe3.jpg).  
      
      
    !! You must not use these two types at the same time.  
    !! Please let me do either PLUGIN only as for 1 type.  
      
    *Please read enclosedREADME about a detailed explanation of this work.*I recommend the thing used to this work simultaneously with the following works please.*["**Hole Digging Lots**" by Smoncrie](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/index.cfm?id=3599)
