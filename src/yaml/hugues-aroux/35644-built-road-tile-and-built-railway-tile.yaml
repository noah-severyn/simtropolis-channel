  summary: Replace the appearance of a single road/street/one-way/RHW tile
  description: |-
    **Scoty’s BRT** (BuiltRoadTile) files replaces the 4 aspects (by differents or unique tex) of the «tile», segment, of isolated road (street, one-way) when building a network.  
    Also replaces the segment produced by the RHW NAM tool (same as Maxis).

    Eh "oui ma brave Monique" .. Yes, this segment can take on 4 aspects depending on its environment. You only knew one, didn't you! I'm offering you either a new single texture (as before, no psychological disturbance caused, everything's fine ... just breathe easy!) or, as I write these lines, 5 variations. One of which is for the purely nostalgic (set 2-07), those who survived the first shock, but ... still ... don't push it ...!

    For the rest ... the trauma should be largely absorbed ...

    Keep only one \[nnn.dat\] BRT and one BRWT file.  
    At worst, only the last one (in each directory) will be displayed.  
    See the attached images to make your choice.  
    The chosen file should be saved after the NAM directory (this is the case if you keep the ZIP tree structure).

    ...

    I can already see people pointing their noses at me and saying: why Version 2 ? what happened to the 1st  ( ... company ... French joke, and I'll stop here for the chaste souls who wander these pages), well, v1 was on my drive for testing ... but it's gone! RIP !

    Et voilà !
