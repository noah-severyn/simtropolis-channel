  summary: Advisors Team Reskin
  description: |-
    Which team will take over your city council? Will you let Doctor Vu’s clones take over, or will you suffer the invasion of the Robot Morons? There is still this team of young people, led by Arthur, not so much more efficient than their elders, but at least ... at least ... less gray hair!

    **Installation**  
    Choose one of the directories in the ZIP.  
    Each contains the team «skin» file and the names file.  
    **Rename**  
    The new names will make the joke in French (or not!).  
    To display your own choice of names, you can edit the file : scoty\_advisors\_\[*nnn*\]\_team\_names.dat  
    and change the names of the Advisors with IliveReader (0.9.3 or 1.5.4 ...) or ask me [here](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/761572-advisors-skin-change/).  
    And if you prefer to keep the Maxis names, just delete this file.
