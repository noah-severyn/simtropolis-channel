    WW-SideWalk4 is a replacement texture pack for Maxis sidewalks and more...

    The associated grass texture is that of [SuddenValley](https://www.sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/37-terrain-mods-and-tree-controllers/29-gobias-sudden-valley-terrain-mod). Uniform textures for §, §§ and §§§.

    This pack offers to cover the Maxis textures:

    .. 3 sidewalk textures (wealth §, §§, §§§).

    .. Edge for railway network and/or rural network (0840..).

    .. Garden textures for Res§, §§, §§§

    .. Plazas textures.

    .. Asphalt 0, §, §§, §§§ ..

    The pack is offered with the SCILT textures in the 3 sidewalks textures.

    **INSTALLATION**

    Unzipped into the Plugins/ directory and... that's it!

      
     If you want to adapt this pack for another grass texture, you can find on my [Drive](https://1drv.ms/f/c/e311098145fffe50/QlD-_0WBCREggOOnBQAAAAAA6G50bYWdkvTx1w) the Fabrik of this pack: Scoty-WW-SideWalk4\_Fabrik\_241228.zip

    And, of course, this Fabrik comes with the BMPs directory for GoFSH.

    *… Special thanks for MGB who inspired this pack !*
