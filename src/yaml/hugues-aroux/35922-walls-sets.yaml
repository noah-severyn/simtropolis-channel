#   description: |-
#     This plugin offers Lots of “Walls on Slopes” in 6 sets of textures:  
#     **Sandstone, Granite, Brick, Concrete, Rubble and Retaining**  
#     (see attached illustrations).

#     Each set has around 35 pieces, it depends... of my mood. The textures adapt to the different shapes that the Terrain tiles can take. Lots are of several types:

#     -   Straight – 1 to 3 variations,
#     -   Intermediate straight (without wall, parapet or fence),
#     -   Stairs - (pedestrian Transit Enable) simple and double tile ramp from MAS71,
#     -   Diagonal Top - 1 to 4 variations of the ground,
#     -   Diagonal Bottom - 1 to 4 var' + L|R ends of wall pieces,
#     -   Inner corner,
#     -   Outer corner (rare that one... isn’t it!) - with L|R ends of wall,
#     -   Filler - to «close» a space or extend the parapet on the flat (or not) tiles,
#     -   Transition - joining two (textures) walls,
#     -   Underbridge - from the left/right for 3 terrain heights: 8, 15 and 22 m.

#     I would like to mention here the contribution of [@rsc204](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/651629-rsc204/) which offered the small, but no less essential, Prop which made it possible to manufacture the «underbridges» quickly and easily. For your pleasure .. and mine!  
#     Speaking of Bridge, the **Sandstone, Concrete and Retaining sets are «floodable»**, meaning that several pieces of this set can be placed on submerged Terrain tiles (Maxis water).

#     Speaking of water, diagonal pieces (for all sets) come with either a grassy/sidewalk half or «empty»!  
#     That is to say that part of it is transparent and allows the Terrain to be seen. This implies, in a standard game situation, the appearance of the «water bug» after using the Pipes tool... Unless of course you use the solution proposed here:  
#      .. Simtropolis <[coris-partial-water-bug-fix](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/760847-coris-partial-water-bug-fix-ready-for-testing/?tab=comments#comment-1767299)\> Topic ..  
#     Otherwise, well... don’t use these Lots! You have been warned ;-)!

#     **Installation**  
#     Unzip the file to your Plugins/ directory.  
#     The 6 Sets will be in Scoty/scoty Walls Sets/  
#     If you do not wish to keep all 6 sets, take care to always keep: MGB\_UBprop\_ScotyWalls.dat

#     **Use**  
#     The Lots of the Scoty Walls Sets are present in the «Energy - electrical network» menu of the game. The Sets and their Lots in (almost) the order in which I present them above.  
#     Each Lot has an orange arrow indicating the top of it. For so-called “Filler” Lots, this arrow indicates the interior of the zone they define (as opposed to the parapet, barrier, etc.).

#     Like many textures of this type, the deformation beyond 12-15 m of elevation is quite strong, but the "Concrete" and "retaining" walls should support more stretching.

#     Yes, yes, I'm a big lazy guy and a bit teasing, and you will have to rack your brains to make certain connections between textures.

#     The ZIP contains an illustrated guide, which also shows the transition textures.
