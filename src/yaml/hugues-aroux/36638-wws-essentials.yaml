  description: |-
    With version 2, WWS - Essentials becomes truly essential for WestWindStreets production fans.

    The directory is equipped with transition textures between WWS SAMs; which you will find in the directory: /zWWS\_SAMxSAM.

    Keep only the transitions whose two numbers, which compose the name, are installed WWS SAMs.

    Please note that as usual, I share the "[Fabrik](https://1drv.ms/f/c/e311098145fffe50/QlD-_0WBCREggOOnBQAAAAAA6G50bYWdkvTx1w)"  of these textures, in order to assign them the grass of your choice via RIVIT's GoFSH.

    ...

    Although not "Essential" (![*:yes:](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_19.gif "*:yes:")![*;)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_2.gif "*;)")), the files contained in this directory are highly recommended. That is why they are proposed as a dependency of WestWindStreets. They allow you to fully benefit from the long hours it took me - will take me - to create the SideMod (or T21) of the WestWindStreets SAM ...

    They may be useful to other SideMod developersâ€¦ such as! [****\[1\]****](#_ftn1)

    That being said, for the more curious, here is a little explanation:

    The files redeclare the Exemplars \[Props\] of various Props of the authors concerned, by adding a property (and strictly this one under Reader 0.93) essential to SC4 to position the said Prop on the network tile (street, road, ...) in its Mirrored version.

    The property of exemplar is: \[ ResourceKeyType1xm \] -> same value as \[ ResourceKeyType1 \].

    \----

    In the readme PDF is the list of affected Props. If their authors wish to update their Props, although it may prove tedious for this simple and perhaps unique use, I would be happy to remove the exemplar redeclaration.

    \[1\] The "high" position in the overrides stack (in my directory:  ../Plugins/z\_\_\_\_scoty\_mods/) allows everyone to call it!
