    **SFBT Street Tree Mod T21 overhaul.**

    The plugin: SFBT Street Tree Mod, by Andreas, available on [ST : bsc-sfbt\-street-tree-mod](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/16098-bsc-sfbt-street-tree-mod/)  -- [SC4E : 86-sfbt\-street-tree-mod](https://www.sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/23-transportation-mods/86-sfbt-street-tree-mod) offers in the directory: Street Tree Mod/Street Mods/  
    a set of T21\-type files (15) which place a number of Props along the street: mainly trees, parking bays and cars, and more... ; depending on the nature of the street (wealth, density, Zone).  
    Some of these files, despite Andreas’s hard work - great for 2006! - contained a few errors in the placement, overlapping and orientation of bays and other accessories...  
    So I revised all 170+ of T21 exemplars.  
    Mainly: I repositioned the parking bays and cars towards the edges of the street - out of the traffic lane, and I repositioned the benches, trees, hydrants, ... straddling the parking spaces.

    This may have been deliberate for some, but I find them rather strange and unsightly. I’ve also removed the «big potted flowers»!

    The \[.dat\] files have been renamed with a \[z\_\] prefix to avoid overwriting. You can therefore unzip these new (15) files into the SFBT/Street Tree Mod/Street Mods/ directory of the same name (as presented in the ZIP) and choose the fate of the old files.
