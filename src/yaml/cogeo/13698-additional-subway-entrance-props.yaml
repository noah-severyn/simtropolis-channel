  summary: Additional Subway Entrance Props
  description: |-
    This set of Subway Entrance Props is intended for use with the [Roadtop Mass-Transit package](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/details.cfm?id=13510) but it can be used in other lots as well.

    The prop models have been derived from two models made by Mcdrye and RalphaelNinja. These are special narrow versions specifically modified for RTMT (original models in [London Underground Station](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/details.cfm?id=11756) and [Ninja Boulevard Kiosk](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/details.cfm?id=3195)/[Ninja Boulevard Kiosk Model](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/details.cfm?id=3196)).

    This pack contains twelve new props, derived from the above two models, and differ only in the railings' colours:  
    \- RalphaelNinja's comes in eight colours, four classic (Black, Steel Blue, Dark Green and Gray) and four modern ones (Red, Yellow, Turquoise and Deep Blue), in addition to the original White.  
    \- Mcdrye's comes in Black, Steel Blue, Dark Green and Metallic, and has the roundel removed. The Steel Blue colour matches the Maxis' one.

    **Credits:**  
    Many thanks to Mcdrye and RalphaelNinja for their models.

    Please check the Readme for detailed installation instructions.
