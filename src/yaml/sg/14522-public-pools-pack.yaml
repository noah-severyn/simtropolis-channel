    **Public Pools, by SimGoober**

    A set of three public pools, to help develop the neighborhoods of your cities. All three have duplicate settings, and are open in day, closed at night. These also will count toward a soon to be released reward lot, so be sure to place a few in your cities now!

    **Compatibility**

      
    This download is only compatible with SimCity 4 "Rush Hour" or SimCity 4 Deluxe.

    **Installation**

    **Auto Installation:** Double-click the installer file to start the installation. The program will guide you through the process. You can change the default installation path, but we strongly suggest to keep the standard folder in order to make future updates and additions easier.

    **MAC Users:** [File Juicer](http://echoone.com/FileJuicer/FileJuicer.html) should enable you to use this installer package.

    **Un-Installing:** To un-install the files, simply bulldoze every lot from this download in your cities and delete the files from your Plugins folder afterwards.

    **Notes about Nightlighting Effects**

      
    In order to see the nightlighting, you must install the EP1-Update 1 for Rush Hour/SimCity 4 Deluxe, and then afterwards, install the SC4-Update for nightlighting (both can be found [here](https://community.simtropolis.com/sc4-maxis-files/)). If this update isn't installed, you won't see any lighting effects on custom BAT buildings.

    **Disclaimer**

      
    The usage of this download is on your own risk. I try to test my lots extensively, so they should work properly, but errors may still exist. Feel free to modify the lots for yourself and show them in your City Journals, but please don't distribute them without asking first.

    **Credits**

      
    Thanks to the BSC Team for their ongoing support.
